So this was my final project, last semester... and after I finished all other exams and project I had this left.

and we had 2 part, 20 excercises (which last 10 were harder) and research.
the Research was hard :\ I didn't know how to keep going so at the end I just copied from an artical I found that Perry (the lecturer) published which was the same thing as our research...
so I sent an unfinished project, all 6 of us didn't manage to do the research part... but Perry did say that he expects that we won't do a perfect job and he probably will give more weight for the exercise 
and for trying the research!

after this project I was done, and I could just sit in the computer or lay on the bad yayayayayay finally I don't have anything on my head :)

תהליכים סטוכסטיים !
