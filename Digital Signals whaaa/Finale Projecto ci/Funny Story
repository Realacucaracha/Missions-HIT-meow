Project with Yuvik!
Which he was mad at me because I didn't finish in time (we had to send it in 00:00 but it still didn't work for me and he was mad hahahaha
but lucklly I managed to fix it by 01:30 so we sent it late (1.5 hour) but its fine cuz it was night he coudn't check anyway

The problem was one line aaaaaaarrrrrrrr I was so disappointed and happy after I removed the line and it worked....

So by fixing that evil line I managed to finish my part and save the friendship cuz at that moment when we sent it unfinished(at 00:00) 
and it was my part and my fault... he left the call and was mad hehehe 
so all good I guess
