So First time we have a project all 4 of us :)

Finale the 4 Musketeers are together!
Finale the Parlament is together

And I had the easiest part... but the most annoying.... I had to prepare the data and the data was ordered bad with a lot of dates missing
So I had to look for containers in the same area that don;t have a lot of missing data and add data(usually the mean) for what is missing...
and also adding the dates... and it was very annoying but I manged to do it fine.
So I do think that they did harder parts than me... but still! 

and a funny story 2.0 : 
Then I added a couple of things (graphs and distributions..) and I added another thing we did in class which I didn't undersatnd but i though
it would impress the lecturer, and..... IT didn't impress him.
if anything it disappoited him hahah cuz I just copied the code we did in class but in class we did it for other date and something diffrent
so what I did was just wrong and I need to change the parameters... I shoudlve just removed this part... cuz I presented this part and didn;t know what to say
and Ehud asked me before if I know what im doing.... so now I learned that if I don't know it then I shouldn't add it.
