So we had like 4 assignments...
and each assignment was harddddd :\
we did it in pairs so I did with yuvik and usually he did the hard questions....
only at the last assignment I did a lot of work, all the others honestly I couldn't without him (or without Ehud)...
and techniclly he did most of the first,second and third... I did the easy ones haahah
